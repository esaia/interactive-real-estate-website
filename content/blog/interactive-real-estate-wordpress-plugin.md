## What is the Interactive Real Estate Plugin?

<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/interactive-real-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interactive Real Estate</a> is a WordPress plugin designed specifically for building companies. It allows you to create interactive building displays where users can click on different parts of the building (like floors or apartments) to see detailed information. Think of it as a digital, interactive map of your property.

With this plugin, you can:

- **Display 2D/3D floor plans:** Show floor plans and apartment images, including area (m²), floor number, and room count.
- **Clickable polygons:** Add clickable polygons to show property details.

The best part? You don’t need to be a tech expert to use it. The plugin is designed to be user-friendly, so even if you’ve never coded before, you can create stunning interactive displays.
