# Shortcode Placement

A shortcode is a WordPress-specific code that can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated code.

Easily embed interactive property images anywhere on your WordPress site using our simple shortcode system.

## How to Find Your Shortcode

1. After creating an interactive image, look in the **lower left corner** of the editor screen
2. You'll see your unique shortcode (e.g., `[irep_project id="123"]`)
3. Click to highlight and copy the entire shortcode
