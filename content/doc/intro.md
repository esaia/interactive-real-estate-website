# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Interactive Real Estate Plugin! âš¡

Interactive Real Estate is the most innovative WordPress plugin for creating **interactive buildings** and property displays. Quickly add pins, vector shapes, and create SVG, all without needing to write any code. With easy navigation through different building layers, users can get detailed information about each unit directly from the visual interface. For example how many flat is **reserved/sold/available** on floor 12.

This plugin provides an interactive experience for real estate listings, enabling potential buyers or renters to visually explore properties.
