# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Interactive Real Estate WordPress Plugin! ⚡

This plugin is the most innovative WordPress plugin for creating **interactive buildings** and property displays. Quickly add pins, vector shapes, and create SVG, all without needing to write any code. With easy navigation through different building layers, users can get detailed information about each unit directly from the visual interface. Display floor plans, property details and 2D/3D photos.

**Q: What is an Interactive Image?**

Interactive images allow users to engage with specific elements by hovering or clicking on them. These polygons activate various responses, such as displaying details, redirecting to a webpage, executing scripts, or opening pop-up.

This WordPress plugin provides an interactive experience for building / contruction companies, enabling potential buyers or renters to visually explore properties.
